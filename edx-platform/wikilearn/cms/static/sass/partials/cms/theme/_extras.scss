// Note: the red theme doesn't provide any additional rules.

// The _extras.scss file is imported after all other rules by
// the Studio Sass. For your own theme, you can override this file
// to add any custom rules that you need. You can also import
// partials directly into this file so that you can break your
// rules into modular pieces.
